# Changelog

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 1adc4c7: Republish with an npm provenance attestation (built and published by GitHub Actions). The earlier versions were published from a local machine without provenance. No code changes.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a6d61c7: Licensing by origin. Original packages (tensor-backend, backend-cpu, backend-mlx, backend-webgpu, pyjson, hf-cache) are relicensed from Apache-2.0 to MIT. Packages that port laya-mlx / Laya code stay Apache-2.0 with their NOTICE. laya, laya-router and laya-cli are included to ship alongside `@johnhenry/math-plus-safetensors` on npm.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7fecf44: Initial release: the laya-js package family (0.1.0). See each package's CHANGELOG.md for what ships, and the root README for parity results.

First npm distribution of `@johnhenry/hf-cache` (never published under any other name). Part of the initial laya-js release; see the [root README](https://github.com/johnhenry/laya-js#readme) for the family and its parity results.

- **Hugging Face Hub file resolution with the `huggingface_hub` cache layout** on Node/Bun/Deno (files Python downloaded are reused offline and vice versa) and the Cache API in browsers. [af2d5dc](https://github.com/johnhenry/laya-js/commit/af2d5dc).
- **No runtime dependencies**: the unused `@huggingface/hub` dependency was removed.
